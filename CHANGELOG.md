# Changelog

## 0.3.2 - 2026-01-18

### Changed
- **Skip-friendly cancel behavior**: When user cancels/dismisses the interview, the tool now returns context-aware messages:
  - No answers provided → "User skipped the interview without providing answers. Proceed with your best judgment - use recommended options where specified, make reasonable choices elsewhere. Don't ask for clarification unless absolutely necessary."
  - Partial answers provided → "User cancelled the interview with partial responses: [responses]. Proceed with these inputs and use your best judgment for unanswered questions."
- **Timeout preserves partial answers**: If the interview times out with partial responses, they're now included in the result message
- Cancel and timeout requests now include current form responses so the agent can use partial input

## 0.3.1 - 2026-01-17

### Changed
- **Other input**: Changed from single-line text input to auto-growing textarea with line wrapping

### Fixed
- **Overflow layout bug**: Code blocks no longer expand beyond container and break page layout
  - Added `min-width: 0` to flex containers to allow proper shrinking
  - Fixed `.code-block-lines-container` to use `min-width: 100%` instead of `width: 100%`
- **Done button alignment**: Added missing `display: flex` to `.done-item` (flex properties were being ignored)
- **Session bar responsive margin**: Fixed 4px gap at 720px breakpoint where margin didn't match container padding

## 0.3.0 - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Code blocks**: Display code snippets in questions and options
  - Question-level `codeBlock` field shown below question text, above options
  - Rich options: options can be `{ label, code? }` objects instead of plain strings
  - Syntax highlighting for diff (`lang: "diff"`) with green/red line coloring
  - Optional file path and line range display in header
  - Line highlighting via `highlights` array
  - Line numbers shown when `file` or `lines` specified
- **Light markdown in questions**: Question titles and context now render `**bold**`, `` `code` ``, and auto-break numbered lists
- **Default theme toggle hotkey**: `Cmd+Shift+L` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+L` (Windows/Linux) now works out of the box
- **Fixed port setting**: Configure `port` in settings to use a consistent port across sessions
- Shared settings module (`settings.ts`) for consistent settings access across tool and server

### Removed
- **Voice mode**: Removed ElevenLabs voice interview integration entirely
  - Deleted `elevenlabs.ts`, `form/voice.js`, `form/settings.js`
  - Removed voice toggle button, voice indicator, settings modal, API key modal from HTML
  - Removed all voice-related CSS styles and CSS variables
  - Removed `v` keyboard shortcut for voice toggle
  - Simplified settings.ts (removed voice settings and updateVoiceSettings)
  - Removed transcript handling from server and responses

### Changed
- Migrated from `~/.pi/agent/tools/` to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` folder structure (pi-mono v0.35.0)
- Updated to new extension API: `CustomToolFactory` -> `ExtensionAPI` with `pi.registerTool()`
- Options can now be strings OR objects with `{ label, code? }` structure

### Fixed
- Radio/checkbox alignment on multi-line option text (now aligns to top)
- `fileInput is not defined` error in keyboard handler
- `pi.cwd` changed to `ctx.cwd` in tool execute function
- **Paste handling**: Regular text no longer intercepted as image attachment; only paths ending with image extensions (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`) are treated as attachments
- **Image limit enforcement**: `MAX_IMAGES` limit now consistently enforced for both question images and attachments (was only checking question images)

## 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Multi-agent queue detection**: When another interview is active, new interviews print URL instead of auto-opening browser, preventing focus stealing
- **Session heartbeat system**: Browser sends heartbeat every 5s; server tracks active sessions
- **Abandoned interview recovery**: Questions saved to `~/.pi/interview-recovery/` on timeout or stale detection
- **Server watchdog**: Detects lost heartbeats (60s grace) and saves recovery before closing
- **Tab close detection**: Best-effort cancel via `pagehide` + `sendBeacon` API
- **Reload protection**: Cmd+R / F5 detected to prevent false cancel on refresh
- **Queued interview toast**: Active interviews show a top-right toast with a dropdown to open queued sessions
- **Queued tool panel output**: Queued interview details render in the tool result panel with a single-line transcript summary
- **Sessions endpoint**: `GET /sessions` returns active/waiting sessions for in-form queue UI
- "Other..." text input option for single/multi select questions
  - Keyboard selection (Enter/Space) auto-focuses the text input
  - Value restoration from localStorage
- Session status bar at top of form
  - Shows cwd path with `~` home directory normalization (cross-platform)
  - Git branch detection via `git rev-parse`
  - Short session ID for identification
- Dynamic document title: `projectName (branch) | sessionId` for tab identification
- `--bg-active-tint` CSS variable for theme-aware active question styling
- Recovery file auto-cleanup (files older than 7 days)

### Changed
- Active question focus styling uses gradient background tint instead of border-only
- Path normalization moved server-side using `os.homedir()` for cross-platform support
- Session registration uses upsert pattern (handles re-registration after prune)
- Cancel endpoint accepts `reason` field: "timeout", "user", or "stale"
- Queue toast position moved to top-right with compact layout

### Fixed
- "Other" option keyboard selection now focuses text input instead of advancing to next question
- "Other" option accepts typing immediately when focused via keyboard
- Light mode active question gradient visibility (increased tint opacity)
- Question focus scroll uses nearest positioning to avoid jarring jumps
- Server-side timeout only starts when browser auto-opens (not for queued interviews)
- `formatTimeAgo` handles negative timestamps (clock skew)
- Race conditions prevented via `completed` flag on server
- Duplicate cancel requests prevented via `cancelSent` flag on client
